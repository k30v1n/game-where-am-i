# Narrative
One guy wake up in a stranger place, and dont know where he is. But after looking closely he realises that he are in places that he already know, but they looks different. He is in a dream, where things about his daily life happens in different ways.

# Gameplay
> Obs*: A lot of this things are not working yet

So the initial screen is pretty much empty. The player can move left and right but the camera doesn’t follow him at first (giving the idea that he is stuck), until he performs the basic actions (move left, move right and jump) -> which triggers the initial “where am I dialog” (a second options would be trigger this after 5 seconds or so of gameplay), making the player wonder what is happening for a brief moment.

Each level could be divided into 3 game phases. Which consist in interactions with daily objects and tasks.

Level Work : Part 1 “Which place is this?”-  After the introduction the player should move right, where he will lose control of the character and one question will appear on screen: Which place is this? (Am I at the office?). After the player choice
Jump over piles of documents or other objects related to the first question, the player should move the objects to create a ladder and reach to the other side.

Part 2 : The player notices that he is at his work place but there are many lit boxes on the floor. This part question (a message) appears: - Can I deal with all this work…
This one is a puzzle. The floor would all be made of boxes randomly lit using a two different colors denoting work that the player must do (Red -> Bad (to be done); Green => Good). The puzzle would consist into jumping from one red box to another, after jumping on a red box, it changes its color to green, but if a player stays for too long on a green block or steps into a already green one, it turns back to red + both the blocks on the left and right of it also turning to red. Once all the blocks are green, they all turn back to regular ground/disappear)

Part 3:  The player is trying to reach to something but the environment doesn’t help.
On this part the player tries to move right but there are things coming on his direction that pushes him back to the left, so he has to jump or hide while constantly moving left to get to the end of this.
Where it will be show the question  “Do you like your job?”, and some sort of animation will follow presenting the player take some action after waking up.

Pendent: possibility to add a boss fight (with puzzles)
